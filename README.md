# 463-Project-1
This project focuses on creating a program that reads through a file of stock financial data and sorts it by utilizing merge sort, divide and conquer and fast closest pair. Merge sort will physically sort the unorganized data, divide and conquer will identify the max and min aspects. Closest pair will search for anomalies/outliers in the data set.

# Project Description
In this project, we are tasked with creating a program that can analyze large financial datasets to sort and detect anomalies. The techniques we are required to use are merge sort, divide and conquer and closest pair of points. For this specific project, merge sort will be our main source of algorithm that sorts the data from least to greatest. It will have to traverse and split the data multiple times to perform this algorithm correctly. Divide and conquer will be the algorithm that searches for the maximum gain and loss in the dataset. Fast closest pair will essentially find outliers within the dataset.
