# 463-Project-1
This project focuses on creating a program that reads through a file of stock financial data and sorts it by utilizing merge sort, divide and conquer and fast closest pair. Merge sort will physically sort the unorganized data, divide and conquer will identify the max and min aspects. Closest pair will search for anomalies/outliers in the data set.
